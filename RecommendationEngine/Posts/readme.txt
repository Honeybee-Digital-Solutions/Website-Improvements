A dynamic post recommendation engine that categorizes users into three segments to ensure relevant content delivery:

1. Warm Users: Personalized suggestions driven by User Embedding Matrices (based on explicit interactions). 
2. Semi-Warm Users: Tailored content based on implicit signals (views/browsing) when explicit data is limited.
3. Cold Users: Discovery-focused recommendations featuring trending, recent, and localized content.
