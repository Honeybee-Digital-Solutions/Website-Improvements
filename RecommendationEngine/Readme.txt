Phase 1: Entity-Specific Engines (Current)
We are building isolated logic for the four primary feed pillars to ensure every section of the UI is optimized for user relevance:
1. Posts Engine: Utilizes the User Embedding Matrix (Warm/Semi-Warm/Cold logic).
2. Events Engine: 
3. Listings Engine: 
4. Deals Engine: 


Phase 2: The Unified "Interconnected" System (Roadmap)
Once the centralized database architecture is finalized, these base models will be integrated into a Cross-Entity Hybrid System. This will allow:

1. Contextual Cross-Pollination: Recommending an "Event" based on a "Post" the user liked.
2. Expanded Entities: Seamless integration of Blogs, Groups, and community-driven suggestions as the UI evolves.
